The diagrams below illustrates how the Monarch data model would represent DAF Disease Associations in RDF.  
The examples show associaitions between a between ZFIN Fish and a Disease it is asserted to model.  
Our model uses the [OBAN](https://github.com/EBISPOT/OBAN) ontology to reify the core association triple (green) as an 'Association' node.  
We use the [GENO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology) ontology to represent features of the FISH genotype.  
We use the [SEPIO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/SEPIO-ontology) ontology to represent provided evidence and provenance information.
