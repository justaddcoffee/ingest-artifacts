The diagram below illustrates how the Monarch data model would represent a DAF Disease Association in RDF.  
The example shows an associaition between a between a ZFIN Fish and a Disease it is asserted to model.  
Our model usesthe [OBAN](https://github.com/EBISPOT/OBAN) ontology to reify the core association triple as an 'Association' node.  
We use the [GENO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology) ontology to represent features of the FISH genotype.  
We use the [SEPIO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/SEPIO-ontology) ontology to represent provided evidnece and provenance information.
