The diagram below illustrates how the Monarch data model would represent a DAF Disease Association in RDF.
The example shows an associaition between a between a ZFIN Fish and a Disease it is asserted to model.
Our model usesthe [OBAN](https://github.com/EBISPOT/OBAN) ontology to reify the core association triple as an 'Association' node.
We use the [GENO](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology) ontology to represent features of the FISH genotype. 
We use the [SEPIO] ontology to represent provided evidnece and provenance information.
The example here was taken from the DAF spec spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PrUI8CwV7AejBloWG2e6SNXEz_FSpCeMEwHhcKE9KmU/edit#gid=1006658200) (The record in Column Q as of 7-14-17).
